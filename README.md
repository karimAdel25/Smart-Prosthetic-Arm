Smart Prosthetic Arm
• Achieved the successful integration of the Oymotion GForce Sensor, ESP8266 microcontroller, and micro servos,
enabling precise control of the arm's movements based on muscle activity.
• Established the Wi-Fi connectivity between the ESP8266 module and a mobile hotspot, ensuring seamless
communication and control.
• Configured the ESP8266 pins and read signals from the muscle sensor, allowing for accurate interpretation and
translation of muscle sensor signals into servo commands.
• Meticulously added the Arduino code to convert muscle sensor signals into servo commands, providing precise
and reliable control over the micro servos.
• Enhanced the arm's functionality and usability by incorporating computer vision techniques, utilizing the CV2
library and MediaPipe Hand Landmarker to detect hand landmarks from the camera.
• Created a cost-effective solution without compromising performance, utilizing carefully selected components for
optimal results.
